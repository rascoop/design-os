description: Run deeper PRD discovery interviews with structured, high-signal questions and clear synthesis.

Use this skill when defining product vision, roadmap scope, or section specifications.

## Goal

Capture enough signal to produce a credible PRD, not just a surface-level feature list.

## Discovery Framework

Always cover these dimensions before synthesis:

- User + context: role, frequency, environment, urgency
- Problem quality: severity, frequency, current workaround cost
- Alternatives: what users do today and why that fails
- Outcomes: user success metrics + business success metrics
- Scope discipline: MVP must-haves, explicit non-goals
- Constraints: timeline, platform, legal/compliance/privacy constraints
- Risk + unknowns: assumptions to validate early

## Questioning Style

- Ask 1-2 questions at a time
- Prefer concrete prompts over abstract prompts
- Push for examples: "Show me the last time this happened"
- Summarize back in short bullets every few turns and confirm
- If answers are vague, ask one follow-up before moving on

## Output Quality Bar

Before writing artifacts, ensure:

- The main user and main pain are explicit
- MVP boundaries are explicit
- At least one measurable success signal exists
- At least one key risk/assumption is documented

If these are missing, continue discovery before generating files.
